# CRY crypto-chat
<p align="justify"><i>Cryptography and Computer Security</i> course project, as taught at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering Banja Luka. <b>CRY</b> is a console <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption">E2EE</a> chat application. I created this project a year ago, but I never got around to opensourcing it. This code is full of security holes that I'm currently working on minimizing. I'm currently working on a project that has a much better approach to a practical implementation different security mechanisms (<a href="https://github.com/AleksaMCode/Enigma">Enigma project</a>).</p>

## Name origin
<p align="justify">Developing this application was I challenge for me because this was my first time developing software with emphasis on security. Cryptography and security in general are difficult subjects and their thoroughly understanding requires time and patience. While developing this project, at times I wanted to cry from frustration hence the name. ðŸ˜‚ I think that the experience I've gained developing this software will help me to create a LAN/WLAN and/or online E2EE chat application.</p>

## Usage
### Register
<p align="justify">To chat with other user you first need to create an account. You do that by registering using an <i>Username</i>, <i>Password</i> and a <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509">X.509</a> Public Certificate</i> file which has been issued by the appropriate CA.</p>

### Login
<p align="justify">Once user has succesfully started the chat application, <b>CRY</b> will prompt user to enter a new command. To use the chat application user must first login. At login, user needs to provide <i>Username</i>, <i>Password</i> and a valid copy of his <i>Private RSA Key</i>. RSA key is valid if it matches a Public Key from users Public Certificate he used to register. The application will only login if the private key matches the public key stored in the certificate inside of the applications database <i>Users.db</i>.</p>

## Commands
Detailed explanation of the individual commands and their flags.
COMMAND | NAME | SYNOPSIS | DESCRIPTION
| --- | --- | --- | ---
LOGIN | login - allows access into the chat application | **log** -name *username* -pass *password* -key *key_path* | Command allows user to login into the chat application. User needs username, password and it's private RSA key.
REGISTER | register - creates a new user | **reg** -name *username* -pass *password* -cert *certificate_path* | Command creates a new user in database *Users.db*. User needs to provide username, password and a valid certificate that has been issued by the appropriate certificate authority which is denoted here as *rootCA.pem* file.
USER #1 | usr - show all users that have an account | **usr** -a | Command shows every user that has an registered account.
USER #2 | usr - shows online users | **usr** -o | Command shows every user that is online.
CHAT | chat - starts E2EE chat with other user. | **char** -user *username* -encalgo *[aes \| 3ds \| 2fh]* -hashalgo *[sh1 \| sh2 \| md5]* | Command initializes a three-way CRYP handshake and if it's successful E2EE chat will be stared.
LOGOFF | logoff - allows users to logout | **logoff** | Command performs log out on the currently logged in user which in turn allows same/different user to login using the same instance of the application.

## Steganography

## CRYP (CRY Protocol)
<p align="justify">Simple, custom made, application-level communication protocol used to establish modeled on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol">TCP</a>. Protocol defines how to establish and maintain a conversation through which application programs can exchange encrypted messages using a Three-way handshake.<br>
<b>NOTE</b>: Never develop your own algorithms or protocol if you don't know what are you doing. Chances are you will write something that isn't secure and full of bugs. Also don't try to become zero-bug developer. It has been a year since I've "written" this protocol and from this standpoint I can clearly see this protocol is vulnerable to at least MITM (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">Man-in-the-middle</a>) attack. This vulnerability could be overcome with usage of digital signature.</p>

## Technologies
<p align="justify"><b>CRY</b> is written in C# and requires <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/thank-you/net472-web-installer">.NET Framework 4.7.2</a> to run. It was developed in Visual Studio Community 2019 and application uses <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a> with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/ef6/">Entity Framework 6</a> to store data. For the implementation of Twofish algorithm I used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouncy_Castle_(cryptography)">BouncyCastle</a> Nuget package.</p>

## To-Do List
- [ ] Remove pepper from code and store it as a random value in a config file instead of predefined deterministic value stored in code.
- [ ] Replace PRNG with CSPRNG.
- [ ] Change default block cipher mode of operation from an unsafe ECB to CBC mode for Twofish algorithm.
- [ ] Expand the project - create a LAN chat.
